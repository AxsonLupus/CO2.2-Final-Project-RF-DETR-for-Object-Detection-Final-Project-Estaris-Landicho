# CO2.2-Final-Project-RF-DETR-for-Object-Detection-Final-Project-Estaris-Landicho

This project develops a complete object detection pipeline using the RF-DETR (Receptive Field Enhanced Detection Transformer) model on a custom image dataset. The system covers data preprocessing, model design, training, performance evaluation, and result visualization.



Project Goals:
- To Utilized a COCO dataset
- To Utilized an RF-DETR Architecture for model Training 
- To Determine the Performance of the Model Matrix by Using Precision, Accuracy, etc.



Please note that you must use COCO format in a Roboflow dataset

How to use the code:
1. Replace the API key with your own dataset (make sure it is in COCO format)
2. Run the code
3. Uplaod the code in google collab
